Plans for Hash Game:
The different visual hashes should occur in the following frequencies:
    60% - Fractal
    15% - Hex
    10% - Identicon
    10% - Tflag
    05% - flag

variable = random.random()
if varaible >.40:
    hashtype = fractal
    elif variable <= .40 and > .25:
        hashtype = hex
    elif variable <= .25 and >.15:
        hashtype = indenticon
    elif variable <=.15 and >.1:
        hashtype = tflag
    else hashtype = flag

There should be a setting to have the random rotation of
visual hashes activated instead of just one type.

The values of H, N, and A should be:
    H - 100
    N - 100
    A - .005

These values seem to give hashes that are different enough
but also similar enough to cause the player to have to try.
