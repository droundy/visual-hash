Plans for Hash Game:
The different visual hashes should occur in the following frequencies:
    60% - Fractal
    15% - Hex
    10% - Identicon
    10% - Tflag
    05% - flag

variable = random.random()
if varaible >.40:
    hashtype = fractal
    elif variable <= .40 and > .25:
        hashtype = hex
    elif variable <= .25 and >.15:
        hashtype = indenticon
    elif variable <=.15 and >.1:
        hashtype = tflag
    else hashtype = flag

There should be a setting to have the random rotation of
visual hashes activated instead of just one type.

The values of H, N, and A should be:
    H - 100
    N - 100
    A - .005

These values seem to give hashes that are different enough
but also similar enough to cause the player to have to try.

The data needed for collection is the following:
    1. Hash type
    2. f value
    3. Are two hashes are the same
    4. Human repsonse, 1 or 0
